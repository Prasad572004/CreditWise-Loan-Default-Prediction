# CreditWise – Loan Default Prediction System

CreditWise is a machine learning–based project that predicts whether a customer is likely to default on a loan.  
The project uses **Logistic Regression** and standard ML evaluation metrics to analyze credit data and provide reliable predictions.

This project demonstrates a complete **end-to-end machine learning workflow**, including data preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation.
